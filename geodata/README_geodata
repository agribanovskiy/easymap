How we made topojson file for 'oblasti'

1. Open in QGIS oblasti_new.shp
2. Export from QGIS as GeoJSON with UTF-8 
   (there is some unsolved problem with ogr2ogr exporting which leads to bad encoding)
3. Generate topojson file (-p saves attribute from json in topojson file): 
  `topojson --id-property osm_id -p name -o oblasti.topo.json oblasti.json`
